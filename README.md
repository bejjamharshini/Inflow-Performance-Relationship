# Inflow-Performance-Relationship
This project is a Python-based tool designed to analyze the Inflow Performance Relationship (IPR) for petroleum wells using Vogel and Fetkovich models. The tool calculates the productivity index (PI) based on test data and adjusts it to account for the skin effect. It also estimates the maximum production rate using Vogelâ€™s empirical equation. By entering reservoir pressure, bottom-hole flowing pressure, flow rate at the test pressure, skin factor, and flow exponent, users can generate a comparison of flow rates predicted by both Vogel and Fetkovich models across a range of bottom-hole pressures. The results are presented in a clear table along with a summary of key calculated parameters, providing valuable insights into well performance and production capabilities.
